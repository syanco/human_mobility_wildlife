## Notes  

### General

* Proposed a directory structure in README.md - not positive this is what we want yet... 


### Building DB


### Process and clean data

* using a control file approach for the study period segmentation/annotation b/c this allows future flexibility to assign individual-/cohort-specific study periods according to some covariate (e.g., taxa, location, etc.)
